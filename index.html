<h1> Farook ITMD 361 Lab 1 </h1>
  <p> </p>
  <p> My name is Yaqub Farook and this is my first semester in the ITM department as well as my first website. I am coming over from the ECE department.
  I'm not sure exactly what I want to specialize in but data analytics, cyber security, web design/application development or any sort of front end work does seem interesting to me.
  I'm excited to be in this class and hope to learn a lot. 
  
  
  
  Outside of school I am passionate about sports, music, movies, comics, TV shows, and exploring different cultures and cuisines.
